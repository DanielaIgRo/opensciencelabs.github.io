## Introduction:

Diving into project development can be overwhelming for beginners. A first-timers guide is key to navigate this unfamiliar terrain. From understanding basics to mastering tools, it'll help you contribute effectively. Join us as we explore how to get started in a development project!

## Justification

The world of open-source programming project development is a vibrant and collaborative space, but it can also be daunting for those venturing in for the first time. We've noticed that new contributors often face significant challenges when taking their first steps in this environment. That's why we've created this first-timers guide.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive resource that helps newcomers overcome initial barriers and start contributing effectively right from the get-go. By offering a guide that covers everything from the basics to best practices in open-source project development, we hope to streamline the onboarding process and foster a more inclusive and productive collaborative environment.

This guide will not only be beneficial for those starting their journey in open-source projects but will also serve as the primary reference for all our projects. By standardizing practices and promoting a common understanding of the processes involved, we aim to enhance the experience for all contributors and promote more efficient and high-quality development in our open-source projects.

## Summary

In this guide, we will address the most common challenges faced by new contributors when participating in open-source programming projects. We have seen that the main issues are related to the use of Git and setting up development virtual environments. Therefore, we will provide detailed guidance on how to get acquainted with Git and establish an effective virtual development environment.

Additionally, we will offer further advice for the contributor to start with a solid initial structure, thus ensuring that their project is well-organized from the outset. From the initial setup to active contribution in the project, this guide aims to provide contributors with the tools and knowledge needed to effectively contribute to open-source programming projects.

# GIT

## What is Git?
Git is a widely used distributed version control system in software development. It allows project collaborators to work collaboratively on the same set of files, recording changes, merging contributions, and maintaining a detailed history of all modifications made to the source code.

## How to install Git?
To install Git, you can follow these steps:

1. **Windows Operating System:** You can download the Git installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/). Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the installation wizard instructions.

2. **macOS Operating System:** Git is usually pre-installed on macOS. However, if it's not installed or you want to update it, you can do so through the command line or using package management tools like Homebrew.

3. **Linux Operating System:** In most Linux distributions, Git is available in the default package repositories. You can install it using the package manager specific to your distribution, such as apt for Ubuntu or yum for CentOS.

For more detailed material on Git, we recommend using the Software Carpentry material, which is more focused on people who already have basic knowledge of Git but still face difficulties. You can access the material at the following link: [Software Carpentry - Git Novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
